# Algorithms

## :wrench: Steps to add your solution:

1. [Fork](https://github.com/I4GFUTA/Algorithms/fork) this repository.

2. Add your solution to the folder with the name of your language. Your solution has to be creative.

3. Name your file with a fitting description. 

4. Comment the first lines of your file (if possible) like that:

```js
// [SHORT DESCRIPTION HERE]
// Author: @YourGitHubUserName

...
```

## :question: What do we mean by "creative" solutions?

Well, I'm not looking for normal solutions. You know, the ones you'd find in a book or so. I'm looking for something interesting! Whether that's a fancy one-liner in the language of your choice, or perhaps a funny [eso-language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esoteric_programming_language), or maybe an intentionally weird solution that you don't even quite understand yourself (be sure to document those!). Anyhow, the goal is to have fun and maybe even learn a thing or two. 

**Happy hacking!**
